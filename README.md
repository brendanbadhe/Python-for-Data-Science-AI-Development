# Python for Data Science, AI & Development

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and resources created to explore and learn Python programming for data science, artificial intelligence, and software development. Each notebook reflects my own journey through Python concepts, data analysis, and practical coding exercises. The materials are organized into modules that cover fundamental Python topics, data structures, control flow, functions, exception handling, object-oriented programming, and essential libraries for data analysis and visualization.

## Repository Structure

- `module_1.ipynb`: Introduction to Python types, variables, strings, and basic operations. Covers the basics of Python syntax and foundational programming concepts.
- `module_2.ipynb`: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and practical scenarios like shopping lists and inventory management. Focuses on Python data structures and their applications.
- `module_3.ipynb`: Conditions, branching, loops, functions, exception handling, and object-oriented programming with real-world examples. Teaches control flow, error handling, and OOP principles.
- `module_4.ipynb`: Data analysis with Pandas and Numpy, including data selection, loading, manipulation, and visualization. Introduces essential libraries for data science and practical data analysis workflows.
- `text_analysis.ipynb`: Scenario-based text analysis using Python classes and string methods. Explores text processing, manipulation, and analysis techniques in Python.
- `gdp_data.ipynb`: Analysis of GDP data using Python and Pandas. Demonstrates data loading, cleaning, and visualization with a real-world economic dataset.
- `Largest_economies.csv`: Example dataset for data analysis exercises. Contains GDP and related data for the world's largest economies.
- `api_example.ipynb`: Example of working with APIs in Python. Shows how to fetch, process, and analyze data from web APIs using Python libraries.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/brendanbadhe/Python-for-Data-Science-AI-Development.git
   ```

2. **Open in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code:**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook or use the built-in notebook support in VS Code.
3. **Install required packages:**

   - Most notebooks use standard libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`). Install them using:

     ```powershell
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
     ```
